This sandbox provides an environment to learn and explore on Google Cloud (GCP).

#### What are sandboxes?

Sandboxes give you a configured environment to start playing and exploring using an unstructured learning approach. They're great for experimenting and trying samples.

The Google Cloud account credentials provided in this sandbox allow you to interact with Google Cloud through the CLI or by logging in to the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
You can see the full list of services that you can access in this sandbox [here](https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/support/cloud-lab-specifications.html#gcp).
